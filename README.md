# task-manager-deno
This would be a demo project to help me better understand how to use Deno and TS without prior knowledge. 
the goal is to build a basic task manager for users to add, change, and manage their tasks. 
the main technical parts I'll be learning to incorporate and use are the following:
1. the GitHub, vs code environments.
2. Deno, ts, and git popular commands.
3. ts syntax, as well as both Deno's standard library and ts's libraries.
4. Handling JSON data in both writing, reading, and parsing.
5. build a basic command line interface.
6. practicing crud operations.
7. using different External APIs, HTTP methods, and clients, Async\Await,
8. practicing documentation

   ** The following project will be full of mistakes. but hey, there is no 'I' in quitting! (actually, there are 2 so at least I won't be alone)  :) **
